1. variable in shell scripting

Def :- variable is a name that stores a value(like text,number or other result of the command) which
         you can reuse throughout the script. 

Rules for declaring variable
------------------------------
1. variable name contains collection of letter( a-z, A-Z), digits(0-9) and underscore

Note - variable starts with special characters and numbers are not consider as variables.

EX - a=10
     b=14
     name="mahi"

2. space not allowed in variables.

3. use doller($) symbol to access variable values

vi script.sh   
        a=90
        b=70
        name="mahi"
       echo "a value is $a"
       echo "b value is $b"
       echo "name is $name"
 4. if you have multiple values as same variables it will consider last one as the variable.

 5. variable names are case sensitive

Types of variables
-------------------
1. system defined variables(environmental variable)-- env
# env
#env |wc -l
#echo $USER
#echo $HISSIZE
2. program/user defined variables

ex- age=28
    name=mahi
    job=admin
3, command line arguments, when ur running a script along with some numbers, values on command line that
 we can called as command line arguments.

ex- sh test1.sh one 10 25 mahi

echo $0----> file name
echo $1-----> 1st argument
echo $2-------->2nd argument

note - it will take by defulat one value only $ symbol

if you have no of charectors use {  } like echo{argument no} echo{25}
